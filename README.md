# Shane O'Dell - Personal Website

This is my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Deployment

This site is deployed using GitHub Pages.

### Custom Domain Setup (Future)

To add a custom domain later:
1. Add a `CNAME` file with your domain name
2. Configure DNS settings with your domain registrar
3. Update GitHub Pages settings in repository settings

## 📝 Development

Simply edit the HTML, CSS, and add any additional files. Changes pushed to the main branch will be automatically deployed.
